we will be
-implemtning http request
-using clean clean architecture
-and using dio



Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that can help you build more modular, maintainable, and testable Flutter apps.

Dio is a HTTP client library that simplifies the process of making HTTP request and changeling responses in dart
Benefits include:
-simplified HTTP request handling
